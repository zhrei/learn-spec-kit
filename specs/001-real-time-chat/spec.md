# Feature Specification: Real-time chat system with message history and user presence

**Feature Branch**: `001-real-time-chat`  
**Created**: 2025-09-24  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Real-time chat system with message history and user presence"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-24
- Q: Do we support only 1:1 conversations for MVP, or also group conversations? ‚Üí A: 1:1 only
- Q: Which presence signals are required for MVP? ‚Üí A: Online/offline only
- Q: What are the MVP limits for message size and send rate? ‚Üí A: Max 2KB; 10 msgs/5s/user
- Q: How long should message history be retained? ‚Üí A: 30 days (rolling)
- Q: How frequently should online/offline presence be updated to users? ‚Üí A: Instantly on change (push)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a signed-in user, I can send and receive messages in real time in a conversation and see other participants‚Äô presence (online/offline) while being able to browse past messages in that conversation.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** two users are in the same conversation, **When** User A sends a text message, **Then** both users see the new message appear in the conversation view without manual refresh, and the message shows a server timestamp.
2. **Given** a user opens a conversation with existing messages, **When** they scroll up, **Then** older messages load in order until the start of history (or the 30-day retention limit) is reached.
3. **Given** a user loses network connectivity during an active conversation, **When** connectivity is restored, **Then** no duplicate visible messages appear, message order remains consistent, and the latest messages since disconnection are visible.
4. **Given** a user opens their conversation list, **When** another participant becomes online or goes offline, **Then** the presence indicator updates within 1s of the status change.

### Edge Cases
- Concurrent sends from multiple users: ordering is consistent and clearly defined (by server time) in the UI.
- Long conversations: history loading remains responsive when fetching older pages of messages.
- Large messages or rapid bursts: UI remains usable; messages are neither truncated nor reordered incorrectly. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum message size and rate limits]
- Presence flapping: transient connectivity changes MUST NOT cause presence to toggle.
- Cross-device sessions: presence correctly reflects at most one "active" state while others show last seen.
- Timezones: timestamps display in the user‚Äôs locale while ordering is consistent globally.
 - History beyond 30 days is unavailable and does not surface in UI or APIs.
- Messages exceeding 2KB are rejected with a clear error and are not sent.
- Sending more than 10 messages within 5 seconds per user triggers a rate-limit error.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Users MUST be able to create or access conversations and exchange text messages in real time.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST persist message history and allow users to browse earlier messages by scrolling/updating the view.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST display participant presence: online/offline only (no last seen, no typing) within active conversations.
- **FR-004**: Message ordering MUST be stable and based on a single authoritative source so that all participants see the same order.
- **FR-005**: After temporary disconnection, users MUST see all missed messages and MUST NOT see duplicate visible messages upon reconnection.
- **FR-006**: Only conversation participants MUST be able to view conversation messages and presence.
- **FR-007**: The UI MUST clearly display message timestamps and sender identity for each message.
- **FR-008**: Conversation list MUST surface recent conversations with latest message preview and online/offline presence indicators per conversation. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: sort rules and pin/mute behavior]
- **FR-009**: Users MUST be able to start 1:1 conversations only; group conversations are out of scope for MVP.
- **FR-010**: Message size MUST be limited to 2KB; server rejects larger messages with a clear error.
- **FR-011**: Send rate MUST be limited to 10 messages per 5 seconds per user; exceeding the limit returns a rate-limit error.
- **FR-012**: Message history retention is 30 days rolling; older messages are not retrievable by users.
- **FR-013**: Presence updates MUST be pushed instantly on change and visible to other users within ‚â§1s.

*Ambiguities to resolve:*
- **Auth & roles**: What user types exist, and are there moderators/admins? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- **Retention**: How long MUST message history be retained (time-based or count-based)? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- **Search/filters**: Is message search part of MVP? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- **Attachments/reactions**: Are non-text messages in scope? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- **Notifications**: Are push/email/mobile notifications required? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: identity, display name, avatar, presence status.
- **Conversation**: unique id, participants (exactly two), type: 1:1 only, created at.
- **Membership**: mapping of user to conversation for 1:1; exactly two participants; roles are not used.
- **Message**: id, conversation id, sender id, body (text), created at (server), optional edited/deleted flags. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: edit/delete in scope]
- **Presence**: user id, status (online/offline).
